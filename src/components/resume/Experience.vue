      <p>Forgerock develops the reference sandbox implementation for Open Banking at https://directory.ob.forgerock.financial. Forgerock as an OIDC expert leverages it’s own OIDC stack to implement FAPI standard APIs. This evolved into building a SaaS offering for banks to hit the PSD2 deadlines https://www.forgerock.com/open-banking-sandbox . We leveraged CI/CD best practices along with Kubernetes as a platform to deploy microservices. We support the community that uses the sandbox via the official open banking slack channel.</p>

Data is encrypted at rest and can only be decrypted when interacting with the user. The survey applications needs to scale to the size of the nation as it will host the next official Census in which the nation will complete the survey online.

      <p>
        Gresham Computing plc is a leading software and services company that specialises in providing real-time financial transaction control solutions to the global matching and reconciliation market. The reconciliation software has evolved to become web-based and I have played a key part in designing, developing, and documenting a RESTful API to serve a highly available, asynchronous web client where performance, scalability and security is essential. A part of development meant manipulating and enhancing pre-existing back-end services to best serve the RESTful tier. Automated testing is vital which meant Acceptance test, Integration test, and Unit tests had to be written for all code/new features.
        <br />Due to tight deadlines and high demand for the product I was approached by the CTO to be a part of a rapid response team which meant working on-site in Singapore for 2 weeks to triage issues as they came in and do upfront analysis to give immediate feedback to customers. Since then I have assisted one of our largest customers in their go live process onsite in Chennai, India.
